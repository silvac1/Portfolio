      <h2>Hello. My name is <span class="highlight">Celso Silva</span></h2>
      <p>A web developer enthusiast with a strong background in linux and open-source software. During my previous role collaborating with developers at Microsoft I was inspired to learn more about software development. Launch Academy's 18 week Full-Stack development bootcamp has made me fluent in Ruby, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and React. Additionally, I became fluent in broader concepts such as database organization and access, flow control, Github use, test-driven development, pair programming, and object-oriented programming. Success in the program was dependent upon the ability to learn new skills quickly, collaborate with other apprentices efficiently, and develop the ability to think strategically and logically when presented with a difficult problem.</p>
